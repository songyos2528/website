## 🎯 What Needs to Happen Next (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Deploy Backend
**Choose ONE option:**
1. **Glitch** (Click link) → https://glitch.com/import/github/songyos2528/website
2. **Vercel** (Click link) → https://vercel.com/import/project?repo=https://github.com/songyos2528/website
3. **Railway** (Create account) → https://railway.app/

**Time Required**: 2-5 minutes depending on choice

**What You Get**: A public URL for your backend API
- Example: `https://your-project-name.glitch.me`
- Or: `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

---

### Step 2: Update GitHub Secret
1. Go to: https://github.com/songyos2528/website/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click: **New repository secret**
3. Set:
   ```
   Name: VITE_API_URL
   Value: <the URL from Step 1>
   ```
4. Click: **Add secret**

**Time Required**: 1 minute

**What It Does**: Tells your frontend where to find the backend

---

### Step 3: Trigger Frontend Rebuild (Optional - Will Happen Automatically)
The frontend will automatically rebuild, OR you can manually trigger it:
```bash
cd D:\Website
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy"
git push origin main
```

**Time Required**: 2-3 minutes for build

**What It Does**: Rebuild frontend with the correct backend URL
